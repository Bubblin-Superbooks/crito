But in reality they can do neither; for they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is the result of chance.</p><p>CRITO: Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates, whether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends: are you not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with the informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a great part of our property;</p></div> </div>
